This program computes PI using a Monte Carlo method.

In this program, I learned about several c++ libraries such as iostream.
I also learned how to print using cout and take input using cin.
I also learned how to use vectors in place of arrays.
Comments should be of the // format instead of /*/
Instead of using defines, const should be used.
I also learned how to use inline to save time.

To compile, type "make all". To run the program, type "main".
